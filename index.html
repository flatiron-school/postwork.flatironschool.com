            <h1>Ruby Intensive Postwork</h1>

<p>So you&#39;ve graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you&#39;re super tired because you&#39;ve been working super hard for 12 weeks and you&#39;re anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it&#39;s a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It&#39;s there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. </p>

<p>This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it&#39;s a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. </p>

<p>Be better, it&#39;s the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don&#39;t sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I&#39;m sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.</p>

<p>This postwork includes review material. We&#39;re never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.</p>

<p>It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.</p>

<p>It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, frontend frameworks, Node.JS, Javascript testing, and even iOS, Objective-C, and RubyMotion.</p>

<p>Be a unicorn, know it all.</p>

<p>Try to pick a simple domain (maybe <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.</p>

<h1>Other Things to Do Besides Learning</h1>

<p>This document also suggests other things that you can do to increase your value.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>Start writing serious blog posts. Use SEO, write good titles, keep the articles professional (so less personal narratives, just informative content). Use clean code examples. Format things correctly. And then start promoting the blog posts. Send them to <a href="mailto:%20elana@flatironschool.com">elana@flatironschool.com</a> and <a href="mailto:%20stephanie@flatironschool.com">stephanie@flatironschool.com</a> so we can promote them to our networks. Ping <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> of <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">RubyWeekly</a> and his other 50 newsletters. We could even start a Newsletter for the 3,000 people in NYC on Rails. You can also contact bloggers like <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, and <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.hakkalabs.co/">Hakka Labs</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/">Huff Po Code</a> and 100s of others (let&#39;s start compiling a list of blogs that take guests posts and developer relationships with those authors). Make it a goal of yours to get a post in RubyWeekly or on a Guest Blog. Be brave.</p>

<h2>Screencasts</h2>

<p>Talk about doing screencasts (maybe even for IronCasts).</p>

<h2>Meetups</h2>

<p>Talk about going to and presenting at all the great meetups around the city.</p>

<h2>Hackathons</h2>

<p>Talk about participating in hackathons.</p>

<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>One aspect of Bresenting is taking the plunge and submitting CFPs (Call for Papers) to conferences. Submit multiple proposals to multiple conferences, to increase your chances of getting accepted. Visit <a href="http://lanyrd.com/calls/">Lanyrd.com</a> to see lists of conferences currently seeking proposals for speakers. Ladies, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen">@CallbackWomen</a> for info too.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never presented in this capacity before (or, even if you have), definitely read everything written on <a href="http://speaking.io/">speaking.io</a>. If you&#39;re particularly nervous about speaking in front of groups, think about first starting small by presenting at Meetups around the city. The more you do it, the easier it gets.</p>

<h1>General</h1>

<h2>Chrome DevTools</h2>

<p>The ability to debug your JavaScript and quickly fix layout issues is a key tool in your web development toolbelt. Become a pro at using the Chrome DevTools by reviewing the following resources:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s always helpful to go directly to the source...the documentation. Check it out here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">Chrome DevTools Documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p>Now, take a deeper (and more entertaining) dive with <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools">Code School&#39;s Discover DevTools Course</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>As you know, Git lets us get into some really great workflows working alone or with others. It never hurts to sharpen your skills with this incredibly useful tool. Complete the following Code School courses:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real">Git Real</a></p></li>

<h2>Ruby Review</h2>

<h3>Foundations</h3>

<p>It never hurts to review the fundamentals of a language. More importantly, though, you&#39;ll gain whole new levels of understanding when you approach foundational topics as a more experienced programmer.</p>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations">Treehouse Ruby Foundations</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations</a></p>

<p>This is a great overview of the fundamental parts of Ruby you&#39;ll use day in and day out.</p>

<h3>Diving Deeper</h3>

<p>The deeper you get into Ruby, the more you&#39;ll fall in love with the language. It&#39;s simplicity and clarity on the surface make it approachable and fun, but the more advanced features of the language make it a joy to work with as an experienced developer.</p>

<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>First, we&#39;d love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed
Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more
resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current
preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon
each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the theme for the site was purchased
from <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap</a>.</p>
