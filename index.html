            <h1>Ruby Intensive Postwork</h1>

<p>So you&#39;ve graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you&#39;re super tired because you&#39;ve been working super hard for 12 weeks and you&#39;re anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it&#39;s a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It&#39;s there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. </p>

<p>This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it&#39;s a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. </p>

<p>Be better, it&#39;s the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don&#39;t sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I&#39;m sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.</p>

<p>This postwork includes review material. We&#39;re never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.</p>

<p>It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.</p>

<p>It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, front-end frameworks, Node.JS, and Javascript testing.</p>

<p>Be a unicorn, know it all.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <strong>apply your learning</strong>: always be building. Use these resources as jumping off points for building new things. </p>

<p>Think of using a simple domain (maybe <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.</p>

<h1>Other Things to Do Besides Learning</h1>

<p>This document also suggests other things that you can do to increase your value.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>Start writing serious blog posts. Use SEO, write good titles, keep the articles professional (so less personal narratives, just informative content). Use clean code examples. Format things correctly. And then start promoting the blog posts. Send them to <a href="mailto:%20elana@flatironschool.com">elana@flatironschool.com</a> and <a href="mailto:%20stephanie@flatironschool.com">stephanie@flatironschool.com</a> so we can promote them to our networks. Ping <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> of <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">RubyWeekly</a> and his other 50 newsletters. We could even start a Newsletter for the 3,000 people in NYC on Rails. You can also contact bloggers like <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, and <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse Blog</a> and <a href="http://www.hakkalabs.co/">Hakka Labs</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/">Huff Po Code</a> and 100s of others (let&#39;s start compiling a list of blogs that take guests posts and developer relationships with those authors). Make it a goal of yours to get a post in RubyWeekly or on a Guest Blog. Be brave.</p>

<h2>Screencasts</h2>

<p>Another great way to get your work noticed and your voice out into the Ruby and larger programming communities is to create screencasts. Think about the resources you&#39;d have loved to find online, and turn them into bite-sized video lessons.</p>

<p>A great place to start is to turn a blog post or two that you&#39;ve written into a tutorial. Try to keep them short, and easily digestable.</p>

<p>Once we launch IronCasts, you can even submit them there. More details on that soon.</p>

<p>Check out the following screencasts to learn a thing or two, but also to see what kinds of formats work (and don&#39;t work) well. Try modeling your own screencasts after the ones you like best.</p>

<h3><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com/">http://railscasts.com/</a></p>

<p>Now out of date, and no longer being updated, but has a ton of really awesome, quality content.</p>

<h3><a href="http://rubytapas.com">Ruby Tapas</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://rubytapas.com">http://rubytapas.com</a></p>

<p>You have to pay for these amazing, short screencasts from Avdi Grimm, but it&#39;s so worth it. These vary from beginner to advanced, but each and every one of them teaches something really neat about the Ruby language. If you were to create screencasts along the same lines, you couldn&#39;t go wrong.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts</a></p>

<p>Solid, solid screencasts. No longer being made, but the ones that exist are great examples of what can be acomplished in a 10-15 minute video. They are a bit pricey, but we&#39;re working on getting them on the cheap.</p>

<h2>Meetups</h2>

<p>Want to meet more developers in your area? Get more experience presenting? There&#39;s a meetup or twenty for you!</p>

<p>Attending meetups is a great way to get involved in the Ruby and larger developer communities. It&#39;s also a great way to check out new technologies you&#39;re interested in.</p>

<p>Need some practice presenting? Want to polish up an idea before submitting to a CFP for conferences? Meetups are great places to present. There are so many out there that they are always looking for people to talk. You&#39;ll be a shoo-in.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/">http://www.meetup.com/</a></p>

<p>There are, of course, other places to find meetups in your area, but none as great as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a>. You can find a meetup for everything here.</p>

<h2>Hackathons</h2>

<p>One of the best things you can do to increase your value in the tech world is to meet as many people as possible and let as many of them as possible see what a great developer you are. There&#39;s really no better bang for your buck in this regard than participating in hackathons.</p>

<p>They&#39;re also really fun, which is a nice bonus. And they are great places to play around with new technologies and get better at writing code quickly.</p>

<h3><a href="http://challengepost.com/">ChallengePost</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://challengepost.com/">http://challengepost.com/</a></p>

<p>ChallengePost is a great place to find both in person and online hackathons. You should lean towards doing in person ones, but if you also want to find cool problems to work on in your spare time, this is a great resource.</p>

<h3><a href="http://hackathon.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://hackathon.meetup.com/">http://hackathon.meetup.com/</a></p>

<p>There are tons of meetup groups dedicated to hosting and participating in hackathons. This is a great place to see what&#39;s out there.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons">Hacker League</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons">https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons</a></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the most organized resource, but it lists huge numbers of hackathons you can participate in. It&#39;s worth checking out every once in a while.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.hackathon.io/">Hackathon.io</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.hackathon.io/">http://www.hackathon.io/</a></p>

<p>Yet another great place to find hackathons happening in your neck of the woods.</p>

<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>One aspect of Bresenting is taking the plunge and submitting CFPs (Call for Papers) to conferences. Submit multiple proposals to multiple conferences, to increase your chances of getting accepted. Visit <a href="http://lanyrd.com/calls/">Lanyrd.com</a> to see lists of conferences currently seeking proposals for speakers. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen">@CallbackWomen</a> for info too.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never presented in this capacity before (or, even if you have), definitely read everything written on <a href="http://speaking.io/">speaking.io</a>. If you&#39;re particularly nervous about speaking in front of groups, think about first starting small by presenting at Meetups around the city. The more you do it, the easier it gets.</p>

<h2>Ruby Review</h2>

<h3>Ruby Foundations</h3>

<p>It never hurts to review the fundamentals of a language. More importantly, though, you&#39;ll gain whole new levels of understanding when you approach foundational topics as a more experienced programmer.</p>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations">Treehouse Ruby Foundations</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations</a></p>

<p>This is a great overview of the fundamental parts of Ruby you&#39;ll use day in and day out.</p>

<h3>Diving Deeper</h3>

<p>The deeper you get into Ruby, the more you&#39;ll fall in love with the language. Its simplicity and clarity on the surface make it approachable and fun, but the more advanced features of the language make it a joy to work with as an experienced developer.</p>

<p>Take some time to really explore Ruby.</p>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-20-walkthrough">Ruby 2.0 Walkthrough</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-20-walkthrough">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-20-walkthrough</a></p>

<p>First, dive into Ruby 2.0. Sure, it&#39;s not the newest version any more, but you can learn a ton about the language by looking at what has changed from earlier versions. The jump from 1.9 to 2.0 was a big one.</p>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-foundations</a></p>

<p>This is a great overview of the fundamental parts of Ruby you&#39;ll use day in and day out.</p>

<h3>Diving Deeper</h3>

<p>The deeper you get into Ruby, the more you&#39;ll fall in love with the language. Its simplicity and clarity on the surface make it approachable and fun, but the more advanced features of the language make it a joy to work with as an experienced developer.</p>

<p>Take some time to really explore Ruby.</p>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-20-walkthrough">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ruby-20-walkthrough</a></p>

<p>First, dive into Ruby 2.0. Sure, it&#39;s not the newest version any more, but you can learn a ton about the language by looking at what has changed from earlier versions. The jump from 1.9 to 2.0 was a big one.</p>

<p>Next, go through the Code School Ruby Bits courses. They dive into some stuff you may not currently use all the time, but you&#39;ll end up understanding some really cool (and more advanced) stuff.</p>

<p>In the first Ruby Bits course, learn the core bits every Ruby programmer should know. This Ruby tutorial builds upon the basics to keep enhancing your Ruby knowledge.</p>

<p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that&#39;s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p>

# iOS & RubyMotion

## Objective-C

Before even thinking about iOS development, you need to become proficient at the Objective-C language. Just like we learned the fundamentals of Ruby before jumping into the behemoth that is the Rails framework, you'll want to grok the fundamentals of Objective-C before wrestling with the XCode and the whole iOS ecosystem.

### [Try Objective-C](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-objective-c)

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-objective-c](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-objective-c)

Code School's course is a great way to quickly cover the basics of the Objective-C language.

### [Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html)

[http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html)

This is *the* book on Objective-C. It'll get you fluent in C, Objective-C, and some other great programming concepts. It's worth a read and a re-read.

## iOS

Now that you've got a handle on Objective-C, you can dive into the iOS ecosystem and start writing apps for iOS devices of all shapes and sizes. Get your feet wet with these resources.

### [Try iOS](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios)

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios)

Get a quick, broad overview of iOS and the anatomy of an iOS app with Code School's basic course.

When you finish that, you can complete the rest of the iOS track.

### [iOS Operation: Models](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-models)

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-models](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-models)

Learn iOS development as you organize and move your app data from Controllers to Models. This sequel to Try iOS will help you master the use of Models.

### [iOS Operation: MapKit](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-mapkit)

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-mapkit](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ios-operation-mapkit)

Learn Apple's MapKit framework for adding real-world location data to your app. Display location data loaded from the web and combine frameworks to enrich data.

### [Exploring Google Maps for iOS](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/exploring-google-maps-for-ios)

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/exploring-google-maps-for-ios](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/exploring-google-maps-for-ios)

Learn how to display Google Maps in your app with the Google Maps SDK for iOS. Get started with the basics and use interactive maps to learn as you explore!

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7)

Quickly get up to speed on the core changes of iOS 7. Make your app stand out from the crowd by mastering new APIs and take advantage of great Xcode updates.

### [iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html)

[http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html)

This is *the* book on iOS programming. Just like it's *[Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html)* cousin, it's both comprehensive and approachable. Read this one over and over again; it's a great reference.

### [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com/)

[http://nsscreencast.com/](http://nsscreencast.com/)

### [iOS Dev Tools](http://ios.devtools.me/)

[http://ios.devtools.me/](http://ios.devtools.me/)

iOS Dev Tools is an incredible list of great iOS development tools, including websites, desktop and mobile apps, back-end services, and design and learning resources.

## RubyMotion

RubyMotion is a toolchain that lets you develop (and test!) native iOS and OS X applications using Ruby. You'll still need to really understand the iOS SDK (and, it's definitely recommended to learn Objective-C first, even though RubyMotion lets you code in Ruby), but it's nice to be able to write iOS applications in the language we all know and love.

Once you buy a [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) license, dive into the following resources:

### [RubyMotion Getting Started](http://www.rubymotion.com/developer-center/guides/getting-started/)

This is a nice, short guide that will get you up and running with RubyMotion quickly with the classic 'Hello World' application.

### [RubyMotion NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/29-rubymotion)

[http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/29-rubymotion](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/29-rubymotion)

Take a deeper dive with the NSScreencast on RubyMotion. It's a good one.

### [Pragmatic Programmer Ruby Motion Video](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion)

[http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion](http://pragmaticstudio.com/screencasts/rubymotion)

This is a great, 50-minute screencast that teaches you how to create a basic iOS app using RubyMotion. It does assume you are familiar with the iOS SDK, however, so keep that in mind.

### [The Pragmatic Programmer: RubyMotion](http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion)

[http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion](http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion)

From the book's description:

>Make beautiful apps with beautiful code: use the elegant and concise Ruby programming language with RubyMotion to write truly native iOS apps with less code while having more fun. You'll learn the essentials of creating great apps, and by the end of this book, you'll have built a fully functional API-driven app. Whether you're a newcomer looking for an alternative to Objective-C or a hardened Rails veteran, RubyMotion allows you to create gorgeous apps with no compromise in performance or developer happiness.

### [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap)

[https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap](https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap)

Play around with this awesome wrapper for RubyMotion that makes it more Ruby-like. It's awesome.
