## Conferences

One aspect of Bresenting is taking the plunge and submitting CFPs (Call for Papers) to conferences. Submit multiple proposals to multiple conferences, to increase your chances of getting accepted. Visit [Lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/calls/) to see lists of conferences currently seeking proposals for speakers. Ladies, follow [@CallbackWomen](https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen) for info too.

If you've never presented in this capacity before (or, even if you have), definitely read everything written on [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/). If you're particularly nervous about speaking in front of groups, think about first starting small by presenting at Meetups around the city. The more you do it, the easier it gets.
