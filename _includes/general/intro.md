So you've graduated the Flatiron School Ruby track. And you're super tired because you've been working super hard for 12 weeks and you're anxious about your future and trying to learn CS stuff so you can get through technical interviews and it's a lot. We understand. But guess what? This is just the beginning. You have a long and exciting future ahead. It's there for you. You just need to keep on walking this path. Keep on learning. Find your strength. Continue the effort. 

This guide is a collection of resources you should get through in the next 3-6 months. We think it's a great use of your time in between interviews. Instead of freaking out and getting nervous, we think this is a better way to focus your anxieties and energy. 

Be better, it's the best way to get a job and advance. Even when you get a job, you should use your nights and weekends for the next year to go through these things. The path is long, don't sprint, but you must continue putting in effort. Be consistent. Develop this habit. I'm sure you all surprised yourselves with how much you learned in 12 weeks. Trust that it was all you, Flatiron School is just a cog in your machine. Keep going.

This postwork includes review material. We're never too advanced to not learn something from reviewing the fundamentals.

It also includes some advanced concepts about code, Ruby, and Rails.

It even introduces concepts and frameworks we never covered, such as Object Oriented Javascript, front-end frameworks, Node.JS, and Javascript testing.

Be a unicorn, know it all.

Most importantly, **apply your learning**: always be building. Use these resources as jumping off points for building new things. 

Think of using a simple domain (maybe [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)) so that as you learn new languages and frameworks, you can implement that same problem over and over again.
