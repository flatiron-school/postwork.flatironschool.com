## Computer Science

### Fundamentals

Many of these courses assume some knowledge of Python (or, will teach it to you). If you'd like a good primer, check out the [Python Track at Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python). Then, check out the following:

### [Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)

This Stanford course teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science. Most of this is complete review for you, but later topics in the syllabus may cover some stuff you aren't familiar with. It's worth a run through.

### [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)

[https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)

In this introductory course, you'll learn and practice key computer science concepts by building your own versions of popular web applications. Again, much of this will be review (except for the fact that it's in Python), but there are some very useful tidbits here, especially in the section about building a search engine.

### [Introduction to Computer Programming, Part 1](https://www.edx.org/course/iitbombayx/iitbombayx-cs101-1x-introduction-1447#.U2uWha1dXvY)

[https://www.edx.org/course/iitbombayx/iitbombayx-cs101-1x-introduction-1447#.U2uWha1dXvY](https://www.edx.org/course/iitbombayx/iitbombayx-cs101-1x-introduction-1447#.U2uWha1dXvY)

This course covers algorithms, basic data types, sorting and searching, pointers, and many other basics of Computer Science.

### [Intro to Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs313)

[https://www.udacity.com/course/cs313](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs313)

This class teaches you about basic concepts of theoretical computer science—such as NP-completeness—and what they imply for solving tough algorithmic problems.

### Algorithms

Many of these courses assume some prior experience with Java. Try going through the tutorial at [Learn Java Online](http://www.learnjavaonline.org/) before approaching the following:

### [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)

This Princeton course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Specific topics covered include: union-find algorithms; basic iterable data types (stacks, queues, and bags); sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications; priority queues; binary search trees; red-black trees; hash tables; and symbol-table applications.

### [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII)

Part II of this Princeton course covers graph-processing algorithms, including minimum spanning tree and shortest paths algorithms, and string processing algorithms, including string sorts, tries, substring search, regular expressions, and data compression.

### [Algorithms: Crunching Social Networks](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs215)

[https://www.udacity.com/course/cs215](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs215)

Ever played the Kevin Bacon game? This class will sho you how it works by giving you an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, enabling you to discover how individuals are connected.

### [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/algo](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)

In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. Divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, practical data structures (heaps, has tables, search trees), randomized algorithms, and more will all be covered.

### [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)

In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design: greedy algorithms and applications; dynamic programming and applications; NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer; the design and analysis of heuristics; and more.

### [Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa](https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa)

**Note:** *This course is super mathy. It assumes a knowledge of calculus. Only nerd out on this one if you are super into that kind of stuff. Totally skip it otherwise.*

This course teaches a calculus that enables precise quantitative predictions of large combinatorial structures. In addition, this course covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.

### [Algorithmic Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink](https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink)

When presented with a problem from a scientific domain, a Computer Scientist goes through a set of steps in order to provide a solution for the problem. These steps include: (1) understanding the problem; (2) formulating the problem mathematically; (3) designing an algorithm; (4) implementing the algorithm; and (5) solving the original scientific problem. This course will train students in how to employ algorithmic thinking by following these five steps to solve real-world problems.

### [Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization)

[https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization](https://www.coursera.org/course/optimization)

Tired of solving Sudokus by hand? This class teaches you how to solve complex search problems with discrete optimization concepts and algorithms, including constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming.

### Big-O

### [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

[http://bigocheatsheet.com/](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

This site covers the space and time Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science. This is a *great* place to review tons and tons of sorting algorithms. It's worth adding as a bookmark and reviewing from time to time.

### [Big-O](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/big-o/0/1)

[http://www.codecademy.com/courses/big-o/0/1](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/big-o/0/1)

This is a really nice, quick course that takes you through what we mean by Big-O. Check it out at Codecademy.

### Miscellaneous
