### [Confident Ruby](http://www.confidentruby.com/)

[http://www.confidentruby.com/](http://www.confidentruby.com/ )

>*Confident Ruby* is, first and foremost, a book about joy. It's about the joy I found when I first discovered how elegantly and succinctly I could state problems in Ruby code. It's about the joy I gradually lost as the "real world" snuck in and cluttered my code with distracting edge case scenarios, error handling, and checks for nil. And it's about how I came to recapture that joy, by employing small patterns and stylistic choices to make each method tell a coherent story.
